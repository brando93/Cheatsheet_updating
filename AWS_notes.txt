AWS Notes

Cloud Computing:

Agile
Quick to change
Reduce risks
Scability: hability to use services/resources as needed
Quick vm provisioning
Global Reach
Slasticity: the hability to quickly provision resources or even shut them down based on demand
Reliability: hability to recover from disruptions or  failures
Availability Zones: full tolerance when a system can remain when others failed just like redundancy


WAYS TO USE AWS:

AWS Management Console: navigation, usability, convenient mobile app
CLI: programming language, flexibility
Software Developtment Kits (SDKs): ability to use aws in existing applications
EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud
--------------------------------------

General Concepts - Acrons:
AWS Snowball: Used to securely transfer large amounts of data in and out of AWS (Petabyte Scale)
AWS Glaciers: A very low cost, long term, durable storage solution.
EFS: Elastic File System
EBS: Elastic Block Store
AMI: Amazon Machines Images (AWS, Partner, Community, Private)
EIP: Elastic IP
EC2: Elastic  Cloud Instance
SQS: Amazon Simple Queue Service
ECS: Elastic Container Service
ECR: Elastic Container Registry -- allows you to host and store your docker images.
EKS: Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes
AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Allows to upload the code of web application and automatically provision and deploy requiered resources within AWS.
AWS Lambda: Is a server less computer service allows you to run your application code without having to manager EC2 instances
AWS Batch: is used to manage and run batch computing workloads within AWS
AWS Lightsail: virtual private servers backed by AWS infrastructure. It's as EC2 but without many configurable steps throughout its creation

--------------------------------------

- Pricing and Support

On AWS you pay for what your use or consume:

  -You pay as you go
  -Pay less when you reserve
  -Pay even less per unit by using more

When reserving instances there are 3 options:
  All Upfront (AURI)
  Partial Upfront (PURI)
  No-Upfront Payments (NURI)

Note: When you buy reserve instances the larger payment you make upfront
the greater discount you get.

- AWS Costs Fundamentals:

  Pay for:
    Compute capacity
    Storage
    Outbound data transfer (aggregated)
  No charge for:
    Inbound data transfer

  Purchase Types:

    *On-demand instances:
      Compute capacity by the hour and second
      Minimum of 60 seconds
    *Reserved instances:
      Low or no up-front payment instances Reserved
      Discount on hourly charge for that instances
    *Spot instances:
      Bid for unused Amazon EC2 capacity

Monitoring:

  Use amazon cloudwatch to monitor Instances
  Basic monitoring
  Detailed monitoring
  Detailed monitoring (fixed rate, prorated months)

Auto Scaling:

  Automatically adjust numbers of intances
  No additional charge

Elastic IP Addresses:

  No charge when associated with a running instance

- AWS TrustedAdvisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides real-time advice to help you provision resources according to AWS best practices.
Whether you are implementing new workflows, developing applications or making constant improvements, you can take advantage of the recommendations provided by Trusted Advisor on a regular basis so that your solutions are optimally provisioned.

CORE SERVICES:

-EC2:

Pay as you go: pay for what you USE
Global Hosting

-EBS Volume:

Storage Devices (HDD/SSD)
Snapshots (You can encrypt your snapshots for free)
Resize storage volumes on the fly
If you'd like to add a new volume first verify ec2 region so you can add a storage volume in the same region


-S3 / Simple Storage Service

Storage capacity
Elasticity
High Availability

You can copy data remotely like this:
$aws s3 cp <file> s3://<bucketname path>

You can copy/sync content from directory and copied it to a bucketname
$aws s3 sync <folder> s3://<bucketname path>

- Spot Instances

Una instancia de spot es una instancia EC2 sin utilizar que está disponible por un precio inferior al precio bajo demanda. Dado que las Instancias de spot permiten solicitar instancias EC2 no utilizadas con grandes descuentos, es posible reducir considerablemente los costos de Amazon EC2. El precio por hora de una instancia de spot se denomina precio de spot. Amazon EC2 establece el precio de spot de cada tipo de instancia en cada zona de disponibilidad, y este fluctúa en función de la oferta y la demanda a largo plazo de las Instancias de spot. Su instancia de spot se ejecuta siempre que haya capacidad disponible y que el precio máximo por hora de su solicitud sea superior al precio de spot.
